           The application stores basic data on a paddler including <Italic>NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER</Italic> and any medical conditions that may be relavent. 
            Additionally, the app stores a name and phone number for an <Italic>EMERGENCY</Italic> contact.

            <Bold>ENTERING DATA</Bold>
            <LineBreak/>
            There are <Italic>TWO</Italic> checkboxes. One that can be checked after the paddler has been confirmed to have read and agreed to any terms and conditions which
            you need them to read <Italic>BEFORE</Italic> they get on the water. The second checkbox can be checked when the paddler is about to enter the water.
            The time this box is checked is recorded.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
            <Bold>NOTE:</Bold> If the <Italic>TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</Italic> box is NOT checked before the <Italic>ON WATER</Italic>  checkbox, a dialog will warn you 
            of this before you can continue.
            <LineBreak/><LineBreak/><Bold>NAVIGATION</Bold><LineBreak/>
            There are controls to navigate <Italic>BACKWARDS</Italic> and <Italic>FORWARDS</Italic> through each paddler's record. When you navigate to a different paddler,
            the data on the screen will be automatically saved. The <Italic>NEW</Italic> button will allow you to insert a new paddler's data into the records and the 
            <Italic>DELETE</Italic> button will allow you to delete the paddler currently displayed on screen from the records.
             <LineBreak/><LineBreak/><Bold>PADDLERS ON THE WATER</Bold><LineBreak/>
            At the bottom of the screen you will see the number of paddlers currently checked as <Italic>ON THE WATER</Italic> to the left. Their names with the time they 
            were recorded as having entered the water is displayed in a scrollable list to the right.

            When you first open this application, the default file <Italic>PaddleData.xml</Italic> is loaded. Through the <Italic>FILE</Italic> menu, you can choose to 
            load and save different file name as in any standard Windows application. If you select a <Italic>NEW</Italic> file, everything will be cleared and the default
            filename will be <Italic>untitled.xml</Italic>. Before this happens, you will be reminded that the current file will be saved automatically first.
            You may save any open file to a different filename using the <Italic>SAVE AS</Italic> option.
